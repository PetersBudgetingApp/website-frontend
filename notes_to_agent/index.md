# Notes To Agent Index

Use this as the navigation hub for durable project notes.

## Update Rules
1. Any time a note is added under `notes_to_agent/`, update this index in the same change.
2. Keep entries sorted by date (newest first).
3. Keep tags short and searchable (for example: `auth`, `query-cache`, `budgets`, `e2e`, `api-contract`).
4. Prefer linking notes rather than duplicating the same content in multiple files.

## Note Naming
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-kebab-title.md`
- Start from `notes_to_agent/_note_template.md`
